    "&#9989;  A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience\n",
    "- In order for us to be able to detect new physics in the ATLAS detector (which is a rare process - showing up as a small signal, or \"bump\", in our data), we want to minimize the background while maximizing the signal making it easier fo us to identify. We have several variables that describe an event or collision in the detector, and the signal would have a subtly different distribution in these variables to the background (which sometimes have to be teased out). Thus, optimising the selection of events which have certain restrictions (i.e. cuts) to some variables, could enhance the number of signal events selected compared to the background."

    "- Missing transverse momentum,  ùê∏ùëöùëñùë†ùë†ùëá  or MET, is used to detect and identify weakly interacting particles (most common: neutrinos). The significance separates events in which the reconstructed MET originates from these weakly interacting particles, or other sources (resolution and inefficiencies). An optimal cut in MET could provide insight on how to improve the signal to background ratio - or signal significance - making it easier to identify new physics in the ATLAS detector."
